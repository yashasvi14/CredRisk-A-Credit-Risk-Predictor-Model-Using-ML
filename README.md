# CredRisk-A-Credit-Risk-Predictor-Model-Using-ML
The intention of this project was to identify the best classification model and predictors for correctly predicting borrowersâ€™ credit risk. The intention is to seek how attributes impact classification and how hyper-parameter tunning impacts the classification of borrowers.
The following tasks were performed on the dataset that was acquired from Lending Club. LendingClub is a peer-to-peer lending service provider that allows individual investors to partially fund personal loans as well as buy and sell notes backing the loans on a secondary market. LendingClub makes historical data available to the public via an API. 

1. Cleaned and pre-processed lending loan dataset having 100,000 rows and 144 columns and created features to assist in accurately predicting loan risk using python
2. Assessed and executed different machine learning algorithms such as XGB classifier, Random Forest Tree, Logistic Regression with SMOTE oversampling, etc. reaching a maximum balanced accuracy of 89% with a specificity score of 0.97 for the class of interest i.e. high-risk loans
